# firstcpp
<br>This is just my first C++ program theres not much to say other than C++ is a very complex language.<br>
<bz>I started by learning the main variation which is written as<br>
<br>#include < iostream> <br>
<br>#include < string> <br>
<br>using namespace std;<br>
  <br>int main() {<br>
  <br>cout << "Hello World";<br>
  <br>#include string for this getline() statement<br>
  <br>}<br>
  <br>And then the rest<br>
Im also writing yaml
